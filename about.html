    <p>Scientific Evidence on Study Breaks
        1. Improves Memory and Learning
        Study: University of Edinburgh (2012)
        
        Found that spacing study sessions with breaks improves long-term memory retention better than cramming.
        
        Why: Your brain consolidates information during rest, especially in short-term to long-term transfer.
        
        2. Increases Focus and Attention
        Cognitive fatigue sets in after ~25â€“50 minutes of intense focus.
        
        Breaks help reset attention, reducing mental fatigue and improving accuracy.
        
        3. Reduces Stress
        Short breaks reduce cortisol (stress hormone) levels.
        
        This leads to better emotional control, fewer mistakes, and improved problem-solving.
